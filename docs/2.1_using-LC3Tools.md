# Familiarizing Yourself with the LC3Tools Interface
Now that you've installed LC3Tools, let's get you comfortable with its interface. Understanding how to navigate and use this tool is key to your success in LC-3 programming.

The LC3Tools team provides a very comprehensive PDF going over how to use LC3Tools, if you would like to use it for reference you can find it here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools/master/docs/GuideToUsingLC3Tools.pdf

However, you should not need to read it, and just understanding these core concepts should be enough

## Exploring the Main Window
- **Layout Overview:** When you first open LC3Tools, you'll see a main window divided into several sections. Each section has a specific purpose, from writing your code to viewing memory and registers.

## Writing and Editing Code
- **Code Editor:** This is where you'll spend most of your time. The code editor is where you write and edit your LC-3 assembly programs. It's designed to be straightforward, with clear numbering and syntax highlighting to help you read and write code more easily.

## Simulating Your Program
- **Build your Code:** After you have written some code you can run it by selecting the "Wrench" icon on the left hand side to "build" your Assembly code.
- **Running your Code:** Now that you "built" your code we can run it by selecting the "Simulator" button in the top right corner of the screen. Once you are on the Simulator view, click the "Play" icon to run your code!
- **Stepping Through Code:** You can run your code line by line by using the other buttons in the "Simulator" left hand menu. Click "Step Over" to run the next line. Click "Step in" if you want to view something happening in a subroutine (we will go over subroutines later!)
- **Resetting the Simulator to run your code again:** Click the "Reinitialize Machine" button (with the "power" icon) set everything in the simulator to zeros. Then click the "Reload" icon to load your built code back into the simulator. You can then run/step through your code as if you restarted it. 

**NOTE:** If you do not reset the simulator between runs you may have odd things start to happen. It is always best practice to completely reset the simulator to get a clean "fresh run" of your code.

## Watching the Magic Happen
- **Memory and Register Display:** One of the coolest parts of LC3Tools is watching how your code affects the LC-3â€™s memory and registers in real-time. You'll see how values change and how the computer executes your instructions.

You can directly view the Memory and Registers while running your code in the Simulator tab on the left hand side of the interface. As you step through your code watch as the memory changes.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Dealing with Errors:** It's normal to encounter errors, especially when you're new to assembly language. By stepping through your code and watching the memory/registers you can see when parts of your code are not functioning as expected. This is the best way to track down bugs since you can watch as the memory changes as you step through each line of code, allowing you to narrow in on exactly which line of code contains your bug.

You can also check out the [Common Issues documentation](/docs/?.?_common-issues.md) for help with specific issues.

## Tips for Effective Usage
- **Making the Most of LC3Tools:** There is a ton more cool stuff in LC3Tools like setting breakpoints, keyboard shortcuts, and other features that can speed up your coding process. We don't have time to go over all of them here, so if you are interested, please check out this [PDF from the LC3Tools team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools/master/docs/GuideToUsingLC3Tools.pdf)
