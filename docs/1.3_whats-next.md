## What's next?
- **LC-3 Basics:** We'll start by getting hands-on with LC-3, learning how to set up the simulator and write our first simple programs. This is where you'll write your first lines of assembly code!
- **Understanding the Core Concepts:** We'll explore the fundamental aspects of LC-3 assembly programming, such as instructions, registers, and memory usage. You'll learn how to perform basic operations and understand how the LC-3 processes them.
- **Control Structures and I/O Operations:** Once you're comfortable with the basics, we'll delve into more complex topics like loops, conditional statements, and input/output handling. This will help you understand how to make your programs interactive and responsive.
