# Welcome and Overview

## Welcome!
Welcome to the World of Assembly programming and LC-3!

This documentation is written to be as clear and accessible as possible. It's written with a focus on students just starting out in computer science or someone with a bit of programming experience. The goal is to teach in an understandable way how computers work at a fundamental level.

## What is LC-3?

LC-3, or Little Computer 3, is basically a tiny virtual computer with very limited memory, space for your program, and some "restrictive" features to force you to learn Assembly at a low level. For example, performing math in Assembly takes more lines of code/steps than in a Python program. In LC-3 for example you cannot simply use a `*` sign, since you are restricted to just adding and subtracting.

LC-3 is a perfect tool for learning because it strips down the complexities of real-world computer systems to the basics, making it easier to grasp the core concepts. Think of LC-3 as a learning playground where the fundamental principles of how a computer actually runs code are made easily viewable for you to explore.

## Why LC-3 Matters in Computer Science

When learning programming understanding the basics is important so that you can build up your "layers" of knowledge. LC-3 serves as an decent introduction to these basics, and is often still taught in Universities. It helps bridge the gap between "high-level" programming (like writing code in Python or Java) and the nitty-gritty of how a computer actually processes that code. 

Learning LC-3 forces you to learn some pretty critical concepts, specifically because it really forces you to slow down and learn the basics. I promise, no matter how much you are able to learn, it will help the "programming logic" part of your brain be trained in a unique way.

Specific thing's it is great at teaching:
- How to write simple code, since writing bad code in assembly makes it REALLY long and confusing.
    * Seriously, it will really train your brain and get you out of some bad habits/confusing ways you are writing your code. 
    * It will force you to keep it simple, which will help make it much more automatic and easy in the future when you are working on any programming task
- Recursion (most of Assembly is recursion)
- That floating point math is super hard in assembly
- Forces you to plan code really well
- How to do multiplication and division using only addition and subtraction!

Things it is really bad at:
- It has a steep learning curve the way it is usually taught
- It can be difficult with how restricted it is
- Using nested functions (subroutines) is tricky to manage (more on this later)

We will go through this slowly together in a clear understandable way. Even though there are some drawbacks to LC-3, we will explain how to deal with them (in the advanced section).

Don't be discouraged, I know this is a lot. We will go slow and build on our knowledge slowly!
