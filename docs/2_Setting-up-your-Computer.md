## Understanding the LC-3 Simulator
The LC-3 simulator is a key tool for you to use, acting as your virtual LC-3 computer. It's where you'll write, test, and see your assembly programs come to life. 

- **What It Does:** The LC-3 simulator runs the LC-3 virtual computer, giving you a place to practice assembly programming. Itâ€™s like a sandbox where you can safely play around with assembly code and see how it works in real-time, stepping through each line of code one by one and seeing how it affects the memory of the LC-3 virtual computer.

## Install an LC-3 Simulator
There are several different LC-3 simulators, most of them however are quite old and do not run on newer devices, so I recommend you use [LC3Tools](https://github.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools) since it is currently maintained and supported on all operating systems (Windows, macOS (Intel/ARM), Linux). (If this changes and LC3Tools becomes unmaintained, please let us know by opening an Issue here on GitHub!)

You can download the application to run on your computer by going to the "Releases" page on the GitHub repo. Here is a link to the releases page: https://github.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools/releases

Download and install LC3Tools, launch it to verify it runs, then continue on to the next part of this guide!
