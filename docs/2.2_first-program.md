# Creating and Running Your First Program in LC3Tools
Now that you're familiar with the LC3Tools interface, it's time to get your hands dirty with a tiny bit of Assembly coding. Let's create and run your very first LC-3 assembly program. Don't worry, we'll keep it simple!

## Writing Your First Program
- Opening the Code Editor: In LC3Tools, navigate to the code editor. It's where you'll type in your assembly code.

The Classic 'Hello, World!': We'll start with a simple program. Although we can't print text in the traditional sense in LC-3, we'll write a program that stores a value in a register. Think of it as your LC-3 way of saying "Hello, World!"

```assembly
; My First LC-3 Program
.ORIG x3000  ; start of the program
AND R2, R2, #0  ; clear R2 register
ADD R2, R2, #1  ; set R2 to 1
HALT            ; end of the program
.END            ; mark the end of the file
```
- **Type the Above Code:** Enter the above code into the code editor. This program essentially clears a register and then sets it to 1, a simple operation to start with.

## Running Your Program
- **Compile the Code:** Click on the "Wrench" icon or select "Build" from the menu to compile your program. 

- **Switch to Simulator View:** Click on the "Simulator" button in the top right corner to switch to the simulator view.
- **Load and Run:** Click the "Play" icon to run your program. If everything goes well, your program will run!
## Observing the Changes
- **Watch the Registers:** As your program runs, keep an eye on the registers in the simulator. You should see R2 change from 0 to 1. This indicates that your program has successfully run.

## Reset and Rerun
- **Resetting the Simulator:** To run your program again, click the "Reinitialize Machine" button, followed by the "Reload" icon, and then run your program. This is good practice to ensure you're starting fresh each time.

Congratulations! You've just written and run your first LC-3 assembly program using LC3Tools. This is a big step in your journey into assembly language programming. Feel free to play around with the code, change values, and see how it affects the register. Experimentation is a great way to learn!
