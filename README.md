# LC-3_Documentation
Simple, Friendly, Documentation and help for learning LC-3. Written by a student (and ChatGPT), for students!

## Before we Begin
Hey! Sky here, I am the writer of this guide! 

First off, Don't Panic! 

It can be really hard to learn with how professors teach sometimes, and textbooks can often be hard to decypher. I noticed that there was a severe lack of resources for understanding LC-3 and learning it online. I am hoping that this can help provide a really good resource while you are learning, and help explain things in a simpler way than you might be hearing

I hope that this documentation can help you. I felt like this guide is what I needed when I was first learning LC-3, since it was so confusing and such a steep learning curve.

Alright, enough from me, lets get on with some learning!

## Sections
Feel free to skip around to wherever you feel is most helpful! You do not need to read this documentation in order and can skip concepts you already understand. Reading it in order will however teach each of the concepts, slowly stacking on on top of the other, so if you are struggling it can also be a great option.
